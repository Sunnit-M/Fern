## Disclaimer
The project is not at all finished and is still in early development.

## Overview
Fern is a JSON based Permission System made to be easy to use and implement, with different data storage methoads.

## Setup
1. Add Fern to your server.
2. Run Server And Allow Fern To Generate Default Config Files.
3. Stop The Server.
4. Select a data type using the table below in config.json
5. Start The Server Again.

## Data Storage Types
| Type | Description                                                               |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | Stores Data in one file with permissions inside of the player             |
| `1`  | Stores Data in with file per player, and players inside                   |
| `2`  | Stores Data in one file with players inside of each permission            |
| `3`  | Stores Data with one file per permission with each player with it inside. |

Only data type one is supported at the moment.
And data does not port to new data type yet.
